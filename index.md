### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorites because it was the introduction of coding.
    I got to learn how to utilize git and create repositories. It was a
    struggle at first but I was able to learn how to utilize it for the first
    which I never could have learned alone.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was also a favorite because I coded my own blackjack years
    ago. I was able to write functions for the cases, which I didn't do for
    the code I made years ago. This allowed me to save a lot of space and it
    made my code a lot cleaner and readable compared to my previous code.

* Lab 5

    Lastly, Lab 5 was a favorite since it was really confusing at first and it
    left me thinking. I also learned new types of variables like "constexpr"
    which I never heard of before. I also learned about limits in coding which 
    I didn't know existed before.
